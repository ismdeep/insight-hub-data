It seems they have a vague sense that when multiple threads are involved, concurrency might be needed: the classic Dictionary isnâ€™t suitable anymore. However, instead of reaching for a simple lock, they are swayed by the presence of ConcurrentDictionary and overlook the broader problem. My hope is that removing these structures from the library would force more people to naively yet correctly use locks and guard them from introducing bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003c/div\u003e",
